# peepchat-ui

This is the UI part of the Peepchat app from Mike North's [Tutorial on Medium](https://medium.com/peep-stack/building-a-performant-web-app-with-ember-fastboot-and-phoenix-part-1-fa1241654308)

## Notes

`ember fastboot` command is deprecated and removed in FastBoot 1.0
Just call `ember serve`
